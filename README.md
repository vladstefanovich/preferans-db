# Preferans Database
>An in-progress database for a Preferans website.
>Its aim is to track the scores of the four participants who play a set number of games a year.
>The create.sql is the schema file and it instantiates empty tables with all the attributes that they will be storing based on the requirements given by the participants.
>The drop.sql was created for fixing errors that may exist in other files and the tables need to be dropped to be reinstated.
