# Preferans Database
>An in-progress database for a Preferans website.
>Its aim is to track the scores of the four participants who play a set number of games a year.
>The create.sql is the schema file and it instantiates empty tables with all the attributes that they will be storing based on the requirements given by the participants.
>The drop.sql was created for fixing errors that may exist in other files and the tables need to be dropped to be reinstated.
>
>'data.sql' updates the table with the current ongoing season (13 games).
>The email and password hold standin values and there is currently only one score type, although more are supported as the game has three separate scores that are totaled to get the total.
>Players will be able to log in and add new games to the database including all the scores that were tracked in the game.
